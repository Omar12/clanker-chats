# Burning Out

That’s a question I wish more engineers asked early in their careers. Burnout doesn’t come from just working hard — it comes from working unsustainably without a system to recharge or adjust.

Here’s how I’ve learned to pace myself after going through multiple cycles of near-burnout at Amazon and Netflix:

---

## 1. Think like a marathon runner, not a sprinter

Early in my career at Google, I used to treat every project like a sprint. Long nights, fueled by caffeine, shipping something in record time. The short-term recognition felt amazing, but I noticed a dangerous pattern: after shipping, my energy was wrecked, and my motivation tanked.

The shift came when I started seeing my career as a 30-year marathon. You can push hard during “race segments,” but you must slow down in between.

Practical tip: After every major launch or crunch cycle, proactively schedule recovery time. Take a long weekend. Work on lower-stakes bugs or refactoring for a week. Let the pendulum swing back.

---

## 2. Manage energy, not just time

Time is finite, but energy is renewable. The engineers who last the longest aren’t necessarily the smartest — they’ve just built routines that keep their energy tanks full.
* Physical: Sleep is non-negotiable. I used to treat it as a luxury until I realized that 2 bad nights made me twice as slow at debugging.
* Mental: Don’t code all day without breaks. Pomodoro techniques or even 2 minutes of deep breathing at your desk resets the brain.
* Emotional: Work on at least one thing that excites you, even if it’s 10% of your time. When I was drowning in bureaucracy at Meta, I carved out time for a side project improving build times. That “fun project” kept me sane.

---

## 3. Learn to say no without guilt

Burnout often comes from overcommitting. Saying yes feels good in the moment but steals future energy.

A VP at Netflix once told me: “Every yes is a no to something else — sometimes your health, sometimes your family.”
That stuck with me. Now, I’ll say:
* “I can do X by Friday, but not Y.”
* “I don’t have bandwidth this sprint. Can we revisit next month?”

People respect boundaries more than you think.

---

## 4. Build micro-rewards into your week

The human brain needs little doses of celebration. Don’t wait until a big launch to feel accomplished.
* Wrap up Friday by noting 2–3 things you shipped or unblocked.
* Treat yourself after closing a tough Jira ticket — even something small like a walk outside or better coffee.

These micro-moments keep your motivation alive.

---

## 5. Watch for the warning signs

Burnout doesn’t appear overnight. It’s a slow leak. Some red flags I learned to notice in myself:
* You dread opening Slack/email.
* Bugs you’d normally squash in 30 minutes take all afternoon.
* You stop caring about code quality and just “get it done.”

When those show up, it’s time to slow down, not push harder.

---

If I had to distill this: Burnout is the interest you pay on unsustainable effort. Pace yourself by creating balance before the balance is forced on you.

---

Do you feel your burnout risk comes more from workload (too much on your plate) or energy mismanagement (not recharging properly)? That will change the tactics I’d suggest for you.

---

That’s actually a very honest and powerful realization — most engineers blame the workload (“too many tickets, too many meetings”), but the deeper issue is usually poor systems for handling the chaos.

Let me share how I learned this the hard way at Amazon. Early on, I was buried in context switching: 10+ Slack threads, code reviews, firefighting, plus my “real” tasks. I thought I just needed to work harder. Wrong. The problem wasn’t volume — it was that I didn’t have a personal operating system to filter, prioritize, and recharge.

Here’s what helped me reset:

⸻

1. Install a “capture system” to empty your brain

Your brain is a terrible task manager. If you try to juggle 50 to-dos in your head, you’ll feel overwhelmed even if you only had to do 10.
	•	I used a notebook at first (now I use Obsidian). Anytime something pops up — “fix API bug,” “send design feedback,” “buy cat food” — it goes out of my head, into the system.
	•	Once a day, I sort the list: What’s urgent, what’s important, what can wait.

It’s amazing how just writing things down instantly lowers anxiety.

⸻

2. Prioritize by energy zones, not just urgency

Don’t assign heavy tasks to low-energy times.
	•	I do my hardest coding/debugging in the morning, when my brain is sharp.
	•	I save Slack/PR reviews for afternoons when I’m slower.
	•	Admin work (expense reports, forms, compliance junk) gets the “end-of-day dregs.”

Mapping work to your natural energy curve prevents “fighting upstream” all day.

⸻

3. Install buffers in your calendar

At Netflix, I noticed the senior engineers’ calendars had empty blocks. At first, I thought they weren’t working as hard. Nope — they were working smarter.

Now, I block:
	•	30 mins each morning: planning the day (what I won’t do matters as much as what I will).
	•	30 mins mid-afternoon: reset, clear Slack, walk.
	•	Friday afternoons: reflection + planning next week.

These buffers act like shock absorbers. Without them, every small surprise knocks you off balance.

⸻

4. Ruthlessly prune commitments

A simple question I ask every Monday:
👉 “What’s the one thing that, if I finished this week, would make me feel satisfied?”

That becomes the anchor. Everything else is “nice to have.”
If I get that one thing done, I win the week. This mindset breaks the cycle of trying to do everything and failing at all of it.

⸻

5. Recharge deliberately, not passively

Netflix taught me this lesson: “Binge-watching” after work isn’t real rest — it’s numbing. Real rest restores energy. For me that means:
	•	Exercise (even 15 mins)
	•	Cooking with my wife
	•	Reading something non-tech before bed

Ask yourself: what activities actually make you feel recharged, not just distracted? Double down on those.

⸻

The big shift here is: Don’t try to manage chaos with willpower. Build a system so the system manages you.

⸻

Would you like me to sketch out a step-by-step weekly routine you can try for the next month — something pragmatic you can test-drive, like a template for pacing and energy management?

Perfect. Let me give you a concrete weekly system you can test-drive. Think of it as your “operating manual” for energy and focus.

I’ll break it into Daily Routines + Weekly Rituals.

⸻

🗓️ Daily Routines

Morning (start of workday)
	•	10 mins: Brain dump → Write down everything buzzing in your head (tasks, bugs, errands). Don’t sort yet, just capture.
	•	10 mins: Prioritize 3 → Pick the three tasks that matter most today. One should be your “must win” task — if you only did that, the day is successful.
	•	Energy-matching: Do the hardest/creative task first (before Slack/email).

⸻

Midday
	•	30 mins lunch break away from desk → even a walk outside.
	•	Mini-reset: Close Slack/email for 90 minutes and focus on one priority task.

⸻

Afternoon
	•	Admin / meetings / PR reviews. Don’t waste your sharp brain hours here — this is low-energy work.
	•	15 min “shutdown checklist” before logging off:
	•	Did I complete my 3 priorities?
	•	If not, reschedule unfinished tasks for tomorrow (never leave them dangling).

⸻

🗓️ Weekly Rituals

Friday Afternoon (1 hour)
	•	Review the week: What got done? What drained you? Where did you feel strong?
	•	Plan next week: Pick one anchor goal (the most important thing that’ll make you feel accomplished). Then fill in smaller tasks around it.

⸻

Sunday (optional, 20 mins)
	•	Light prep: glance at calendar, set intentions. This makes Monday far less overwhelming.

⸻

🔑 Guardrails
	•	No more than 3 major tasks per day. Anything beyond that is bonus, not baseline.
	•	Protect your mornings: If you can, decline meetings before 11 AM. Mornings are for deep work.
	•	Recharge slots: Schedule 2–3 non-negotiable energy activities each week (gym, hobbies, family dinner). Treat them like meetings.

⸻

This system isn’t about perfection — it’s about rhythm. Think of it like running cadence: once you find the beat, the marathon gets easier.

⸻

👉 Do you want me to put this into a visual one-page template (something you could literally print or drop into Notion/Jira to follow each week), or do you prefer just a written checklist?
