# Not Burning Out

That's a question I wish more engineers asked early in their careers. Burnout doesn't come from just working hard ‚Äî it comes from working unsustainably without a system to recharge or adjust.

Here's how I've learned to pace myself after going through multiple cycles of near-burnout in the past:

---

## 1. Think like a marathon runner, not a sprinter

Early in my career in the past, I used to treat every project like a sprint. Long nights, fueled by caffeine, shipping something in record time. The short-term recognition felt amazing, but I noticed a dangerous pattern: after shipping, my energy was wrecked, and my motivation tanked.

The shift came when I started seeing my career as a 30-year marathon. You can push hard during "race segments," but you must slow down in between.

Practical tip: After every major launch or crunch cycle, proactively schedule recovery time. Take a long weekend. Work on lower-stakes bugs or refactoring for a week. Let the pendulum swing back.

---

## 2. Manage energy, not just time

Time is finite, but energy is renewable. The engineers who last the longest aren't necessarily the smartest ‚Äî they've just built routines that keep their energy tanks full.
* Physical: Sleep is non-negotiable. I used to treat it as a luxury until I realized that 2 bad nights made me twice as slow at debugging.
* Mental: Don't code all day without breaks. Pomodoro techniques or even 2 minutes of deep breathing at your desk resets the brain.
* Emotional: Work on at least one thing that excites you, even if it's 10% of your time. When I was drowning in bureaucracy at one of my past roles, I carved out time for a side project improving build times. That "fun project" kept me sane.

---

## 3. Learn to say no without guilt

Burnout often comes from overcommitting. Saying yes feels good in the moment but steals future energy.

A VP at a previous role once told me: "Every yes is a no to something else ‚Äî sometimes your health, sometimes your family."
That stuck with me. Now, I'll say:
* "I can do X by Friday, but not Y."
* "I don't have bandwidth this sprint. Can we revisit next month?"

People respect boundaries more than you think.

---

## 4. Build micro-rewards into your week

The human brain needs little doses of celebration. Don't wait until a big launch to feel accomplished.
* Wrap up Friday by noting 2‚Äì3 things you shipped or unblocked.
* Treat yourself after closing a tough Jira ticket ‚Äî even something small like a walk outside or better coffee.

These micro-moments keep your motivation alive.

---

## 5. Watch for the warning signs

Burnout doesn't appear overnight. It's a slow leak. Some red flags I learned to notice in myself:
* You dread opening Slack/email.
* Bugs you'd normally squash in 30 minutes take all afternoon.
* You stop caring about code quality and just "get it done."

When those show up, it's time to slow down, not push harder.

---

If I had to distill this: Burnout is the interest you pay on unsustainable effort. Pace yourself by creating balance before the balance is forced on you.

---

Do you feel your burnout risk comes more from workload (too much on your plate) or energy mismanagement (not recharging properly)? That will change the tactics I'd suggest for you.

---

# Systems

That's actually a very honest and powerful realization ‚Äî most engineers blame the workload ("too many tickets, too many meetings"), but the deeper issue is usually poor systems for handling the chaos.

Let me share how I learned this the hard way in the past. Early on, I was buried in context switching: 10+ Slack threads, code reviews, firefighting, plus my "real" tasks. I thought I just needed to work harder. Wrong. The problem wasn't volume ‚Äî it was that I didn't have a personal operating system to filter, prioritize, and recharge.

Here's what helped me reset:

---

## 1. Install a "capture system" to empty your brain

Your brain is a terrible task manager. If you try to juggle 50 to-dos in your head, you'll feel overwhelmed even if you only had to do 10.
* I used a notebook at first (now I use Obsidian). Anytime something pops up ‚Äî "fix API bug," "send design feedback," "buy cat food" ‚Äî it goes out of my head, into the system.
* Once a day, I sort the list: What's urgent, what's important, what can wait.

It's amazing how just writing things down instantly lowers anxiety.

---

## 2. Prioritize by energy zones, not just urgency

Don't assign heavy tasks to low-energy times.
* I do my hardest coding/debugging in the morning, when my brain is sharp.
* I save Slack/PR reviews for afternoons when I'm slower.
* Admin work (expense reports, forms, compliance junk) gets the "end-of-day dregs."

Mapping work to your natural energy curve prevents "fighting upstream" all day.

---

## 3. Install buffers in your calendar

At a previous role, I noticed the senior engineers' calendars had empty blocks. At first, I thought they weren't working as hard. Nope ‚Äî they were working smarter.

Now, I block:
* 30 mins each morning: planning the day (what I won't do matters as much as what I will).
* 30 mins mid-afternoon: reset, clear Slack, walk.
* Friday afternoons: reflection + planning next week.

These buffers act like shock absorbers. Without them, every small surprise knocks you off balance.

---

## 4. Ruthlessly prune commitments

A simple question I ask every Monday:
üëâ "What's the one thing that, if I finished this week, would make me feel satisfied?"

That becomes the anchor. Everything else is "nice to have."
If I get that one thing done, I win the week. This mindset breaks the cycle of trying to do everything and failing at all of it.

---

## 5. Recharge deliberately, not passively

Netflix taught me this lesson: "Binge-watching" after work isn't real rest ‚Äî it's numbing. Real rest restores energy. For me that means:
* Exercise (even 15 mins)
* Cooking with my wife
* Reading something non-tech before bed

Ask yourself: what activities actually make you feel recharged, not just distracted? Double down on those.

The big shift here is: Don't try to manage chaos with willpower. Build a system so the system manages you.

---

Let me give you a concrete weekly system you can test-drive. Think of it as your "operating manual" for energy and focus.

I'll break it into Daily Routines + Weekly Rituals.

---

## üóìÔ∏è Daily Routines

### Morning (start of workday)

* 10 mins: Brain dump ‚Üí Write down everything buzzing in your head (tasks, bugs, errands). Don't sort yet, just capture.
* 10 mins: Prioritize 3 ‚Üí Pick the three tasks that matter most today. One should be your "must win" task ‚Äî if you only did that, the day is successful.
* Energy-matching: Do the hardest/creative task first (before Slack/email).

---

### Midday

* 30 mins lunch break away from desk ‚Üí even a walk outside.
* Mini-reset: Close Slack/email for 90 minutes and focus on one priority task.

---

### Afternoon

* Admin / meetings / PR reviews. Don't waste your sharp brain hours here ‚Äî this is low-energy work.
* 15 min "shutdown checklist" before logging off:
* Did I complete my 3 priorities?
* If not, reschedule unfinished tasks for tomorrow (never leave them dangling).

---

## üóìÔ∏è Weekly Rituals

### Friday Afternoon (1 hour)

* Review the week: What got done? What drained you? Where did you feel strong?
* Plan next week: Pick one anchor goal (the most important thing that'll make you feel accomplished). Then fill in smaller tasks around it.

---

### Sunday (optional, 20 mins)

* Light prep: glance at calendar, set intentions. This makes Monday far less overwhelming.

---

## üîë Guardrails
* No more than 3 major tasks per day. Anything beyond that is bonus, not baseline.
* Protect your mornings: If you can, decline meetings before 11 AM. Mornings are for deep work.
* Recharge slots: Schedule 2‚Äì3 non-negotiable energy activities each week (gym, hobbies, family dinner). Treat them like meetings.

---

This system isn't about perfection ‚Äî it's about rhythm. Think of it like running cadence: once you find the beat, the marathon gets easier.

Ah, this is the trap most engineers fall into: you build a solid system, then a fire drill or urgent ping from your manager blows it up ‚Äî and suddenly you‚Äôre back in reactive mode.

The trick is not to eliminate urgent requests (they‚Äôll never stop) but to handle them without letting them hijack your entire operating rhythm. Let me walk you through strategies I‚Äôve seen work across both startups (where everything is ‚Äúurgent‚Äù) and big corps like Amazon/Meta (where urgency often hides poor planning).

‚∏ª

1. Install a triage protocol

Think of yourself as the ER doctor, not the patient. When an urgent request comes in:
	‚Ä¢	Clarify scope immediately: ‚ÄúDo you need this today, this week, or just ASAP?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Classify it:
	‚Ä¢	üö® True emergency: user outage, production down ‚Üí Drop everything.
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è High importance, but not crisis: clarify deadline, negotiate time.
	‚Ä¢	‚ùì Perceived urgency: manager/team just wants peace of mind ‚Üí can often be addressed with a quick update or a partial deliverable.

At Amazon, I had a sticky note on my monitor: ‚ÄúIs it on fire?‚Äù If not, it can usually wait a few hours.

‚∏ª

2. Use the quick response, delayed action trick

A lot of urgency is emotional ‚Äî people just want to feel heard. You don‚Äôt need to do the work immediately, but you do need to respond immediately.

Example:
	‚Ä¢	Team ping: ‚ÄúCan you check this API bug now?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Response: ‚ÄúGot it, I‚Äôll finish reviewing X in 45 mins, then look. If it escalates before then, let me know.‚Äù

This defuses tension while protecting your flow.

‚∏ª

3. Build an interrupt buffer into your day

At Netflix, I noticed senior engineers had 1‚Äì2 ‚Äúinterrupt slots‚Äù daily where they‚Äôd batch urgent requests. That way they weren‚Äôt thrashing all day.
	‚Ä¢	Mid-morning (after deep work).
	‚Ä¢	Mid-afternoon (before energy crash).

When something ‚Äúurgent‚Äù comes in, you slot it into the next buffer instead of dropping everything.

‚∏ª

4. Negotiate openly with your manager

If you constantly absorb urgent asks, you‚Äôll look like the firefighter but never the architect. The danger is you‚Äôll be seen as dependable but not strategic.

Script I‚Äôve used with managers:

‚ÄúI can jump on this now, but that means Feature A slips by a day. Which should I prioritize?‚Äù

This puts the decision back on them and teaches them to be more careful with urgent requests. Over time, they‚Äôll stop throwing random fires at you unless they‚Äôre truly critical.

‚∏ª

5. Keep a running log of interrupts

Every time you get an urgent request, jot it down in a section of your weekly note. At the end of the week, review:
	‚Ä¢	How many were truly emergencies?
	‚Ä¢	Who generated most of them?
	‚Ä¢	Are there patterns (e.g., QA always flags late, manager forgets deadlines)?

This log becomes evidence. At Meta, I once showed my manager a list of 15 ‚Äúurgent asks‚Äù in 2 weeks. He was shocked and ended up shielding me more. Data > complaints.

‚∏ª

6. Protect your deep work core

Even with a buffer system, you need sacred hours when you‚Äôre not interruptible unless prod is down. For me, it was 9‚Äì11 AM. Everyone knew that was my ‚Äúcode cave.‚Äù

Set expectations:
	‚Ä¢	Put it on your calendar.
	‚Ä¢	Communicate it clearly: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be heads down until 11, if it‚Äôs a P1 ping me directly, otherwise I‚Äôll respond after.‚Äù

People respect clear boundaries when you enforce them consistently.

‚∏ª

üëâ The mental shift: You don‚Äôt have to solve every urgent request right away ‚Äî you just have to manage how they land.

‚∏ª

Would you like me to draft a response playbook (short scripts you can use for Slack/email when these requests pop up) so you don‚Äôt have to improvise under pressure?
